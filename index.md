# Cyber Creek VPN info

Cyber Creek hosts VPN servers for plenty of different reasons but the main two reasons are listed below

1: they secure our infrastructure by allowing us to only allow one specific IP to access our corporate logins and sensitive infrastructure

2: We sell the right to use our non-corporate VPNs to other people for their own purposes

# IPs we own/use

|IP|IPv6|Country|Host name|
|-|-|-|-|
|213.136.87.237|2a02:c207:2127:7487:0000:0000:0000:0001|germany|relay.de.cyber-creek.us|

# Reasons why we show this

1: we show this to provide transparency to show that our servers are not malicious if you are seeing our IPs in your logs

2: we also show this in case our IPs are acting maliciously this can be used as a contact point to alert us instead of just blocking our IPs
